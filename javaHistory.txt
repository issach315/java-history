2) Operation stages in java..!

    1.coding
        -writing a set of instructions in a file developer's responciple.
    2.compilation
        -java code is converted into byte code "COMPAILER" is responciple.
    3.Execution
        -All the operations will be executed by "JVM" [java virctual machine]


                                                   
                                                  [JRE (java running environment)]
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                    V
                                                    |
                                                    JVM aking help of [JRE]
                                                    |
                                                    V
                                                    |
{file.java} --->[java Compailer]-->[byte code]--->[JVM] ----> binary code[machine laguage]---->[CPU]----> mornitor{output}
// java having many inbuilt libraies
// java is didved into three types 
1. basic java
2. core java
3. Advanced java

Jvm is directly  convert the code to the byte code
